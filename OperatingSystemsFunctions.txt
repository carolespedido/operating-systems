One of the main functions of an operating system is the Loading and execution. A program is loaded in the memory before it can be executed. The Operating system provides the facility to load programs in memory easily and then execute it.
Another function of an operating system is Device Controlling. It controls all devices attached to computer. The hardware devices are controlled with the help of small software called device drivers.
Providing Interface is also a function of an operating system. User interface acts with a computer mutually. It controls how you input data and instruction and how information is displayed on screen.
Operating system also controls printing function. If a user issues two print commands at a time, it does not mix data of these files and prints them separately. The operating system manages printing and spooling by organising data that is waiting to be printed into a queue. Once the printer becomes available the operating system releases the next data from the queue and prints it. This means that other user and system tasks can continue while the data is in the queue.
